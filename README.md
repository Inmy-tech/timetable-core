#Timetable-Core

In some time I home this will be server of the project I want to create.

I felt pain when I hadn't found proper solution for non-paper time management.

So I decided to create such solution by myself.

##Tech stack I want to use:
* The latest JDK
* The latest Spring Framework Stack
* Kubernetes
* Reactive
* RSocket
* R2DBC
* PostgreSQL
* Docker
* Github Actions
* AWS
* ReactJs
* OAuth2
